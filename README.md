hi guys welcome to my new project this is a ecommerce website and its works but the backend is run on local:3000.

How to run the backend:
1.Open Command promt
2.locate to backend folder
3.type node server.JS
4.done your backend already  running

after that you open the index.html on live server. and done 
don't forget to create your new .nvm for transaction work!

This is example website that contain the backed: https://6f3415a8-a894-49ff-9174-49eb70260194-00-xkci6kdm6gvn.sisko.replit.dev/
